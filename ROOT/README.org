#+TITLE: The "/" of my dotfiles
The root doesn't contain much other than my NixOS dotfiles & my personal Gentoo dotfiles

* Pacman
Also in case you noticed that I dont use Arch-Based distros and I have Pacman stuff I can explain!

This isnt your day-to-day Arch Pacman as it uses a whole nother mirror to get Devkit packages. I have Devkit things installed as it contains
libraries for Homebrew Wii development
