#+TITLE: The "/" of my dotfiles
The root doesn't contain much other than some NixOS dotfiles & some Portage configuration

* Pacman
Also in case you noticed, I have pacman related shit for other distos?
I don't use it as my main package manager for other distros I just need DevkitPro packages for Wii/Gamecube development
