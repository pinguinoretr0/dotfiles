#+TITLE: Why?
I have a ".startx" directory because I want to seperate my window managers when I use startx and not continue changing my ".xinitrc". 
So in order to change this I made this directory and added files with the Window Manager's names as each file is a startx conf specifically made for that WM.

The way I exucute them is through shell aliases,

*EX:*
#+BEGIN_SRC sell
alias startX="startx ~/.startx/xmonad"
#+END_SRC
