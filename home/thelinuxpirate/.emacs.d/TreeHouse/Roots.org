#+TITLE:The Roots of the Tree
The Roots of the tree (package.el) is one of the first exucuted files during emacs' startup;

This file is more a way to secure the configuration and makes sure everything is put in place,
it does this by making sure every package that is declared in the Tree is installed;

(Not an automatic process you must patch in each new package manually)

*NOTE:*

The more packages you add here *and* install into the tree the slower it will be upon usage & startup;
