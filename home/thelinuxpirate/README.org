* Information
I have re-structured my dotfiles repository to have different locations for the folders located inside of my user & root.

Main things to look at:
- [[https://github.com/DarthYoshi07/dotfiles/tree/main/home/thelinuxpirate/.emacs.d][TreeHouse-Emacs]]
- [[https://github.com/DarthYoshi07/dotfiles/blob/main/home/thelinuxpirate/Suckless/Suckless.org][Suckless' tools Configuration]]
- [[https://github.com/DarthYoshi07/dotfiles/tree/main/home/thelinuxpirate/.config/xmonad][XMonad Configuration]]
