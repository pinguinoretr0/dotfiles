*TODO:*
- Find a way to get SSBM-Slippi working on Nix/NixOS
- Set up EWW for Hyprland + Snormacs Desktop
- Clean Up & Document Hyprland configuration
- Add images of my NixOS Desktops to this repository
- Write a simplistic Neovim configuration


* NixOS Machines
*** TheTreeHouse
[[https://github.com/thelinuxpirate/dotfiles/img/TheTreeHouseNix.png][*TheTreeHouse Desktop*]]
TheTreeHouse is my personal Desktop computer which runs off of NixOS.
It contains Hyprland as its main desktop; and XMonad in case of any reason in which I'd need a backup Desktop.

*** ThePirateShip
ThePirateShip is my personal laptop.
Its specs aren't great but its a fine laptop.
ThePirateShip uses the Snormacs desktop configuration as its main desktop.

** Home-Manager
I only have one user and that user is "pingu".
As of right now I do not need multiple Home-Manager configurations/declarations.
My Home-Manager is purely the software I want installed on my system that shouldn't be installed with the system. (AKA bloat)

* The TLP NixOS Struggle
I've struggled trying to use NixOS for about 7 months. 
Now I have the configuration down to contain my configurations at a reproducible level.

Would I reccommend NixOS to other people? Probably not to be completely honest.
There is a lot of debugging of errors and the documentation for Nix sucks ass.
If you have no knowledge of programming you are guaranteed to struggle.

I still wonder if this is the distro for me; sometimes I just would like to go back to Gentoo.
Even if I went back to Gentoo I could still have some things be managed by Nix's Home-Manager.
My main issue is that Nix & NixOS have a heavy dependency with SystemD. So if you don't use SoystemD
or plan to leave it, don't get too excited about managing your system with Nix...
