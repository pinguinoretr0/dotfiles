** Todo List and Updates:
- [...] Rewrite nearly everything
- [...] Write Neovim config
- [...] Rewrite Emacs config
- [...] Create a Desktop-like Sway environment

** Setup
My current setup is EXWM + Arch. It has been working perfectly, as I wanted to switch to Wayland.
I'm going to clean up this repository and try to rewrite most of my older code.
