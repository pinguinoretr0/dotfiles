--------------------------------------------------------
** My Personal Views: 
- *Distro Philosophies:*
*** Top 5 Distros:
- Debian
- Void
- Gentoo
- NixOS
- Fedora

****  Gentoo:
I love Gentoo because it is the most flexible and customizeable distro of them all. There is plenty of support for issues, the commuinty is very 
litty and will actually help you with issues and not call you a dumbass unlike the Arch community. I personally have decided to organize my 
system's dotfiles using Emacs' OrgMode, and document most of the changes I made. Also the addittion of USE flags is a very cool idea and I hope more 
distros or package managers will use this idea in the future. Sure compiling takes awhile (I have a 2 core doodoo cpu) but I find it worth it as
packages are more customizeable.

*** Top 3 WMs:
- DWM
- XMonad
- Exwm

**** Suckless' DWM
I always heard about DWM and after struggling with Exwm I decided to give it a try, I am *very* happy with it. Im too lazy to
patch it so I used flexipatch. The whole idea between Master and Slaves were goofy to me at first but now I see that its goated.
Cant really complain too much about this Window Manager, it just gets stuff right.

# *** The Coding Experience:
# A year ago my computer self destructed and could no longer boot into windows which made me dabble with
# linux systems. It has been a key part of my learning experience with tech. If that would have never happened
# I would have never faced the horros of my Ubuntu installation dying or the joys of installing Arch after 7 hours 
# & the biggest part of installing Gentoo after a three day process. After a while of messing around with Linux systems
# I wanted to learn how to create my own applications and video games which is still the stage I'm going through as of now.
# I started off hoping to use the Unity engine and learning basic C# to trying to use Rust, or C to create my projects.
# - *Linux Tip:*
# A big personal view of mine is that Operating Systems shouldn't be reccommended randomly to people and don't
# force people to switch their system. They will hate it even more as they have no idea what they are doing with it.
