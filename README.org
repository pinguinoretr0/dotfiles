** Todo List and Updates:
- [...] Rewrite nearly everything
- [...] Write Neovim config
- [...] Rewrite Emacs config
- [...] Create a Desktop-like Sway environment

** Setup
My current setup is EXWM + Fedora. It has been working pretty well, I also plan
to write some elisp code that will enable emacs to work more with my system
