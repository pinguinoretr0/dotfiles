** Todo List and Updates:
- [...] Rewrite nearly everything (Close to complete)
- [...] Write Neovim config
- [...] Rewrite Emacs config (Close to stable)
- [X] Create a Desktop-like EXWM environment

** Setup
My current setup is EXWM + Fedora. It has been working pretty well, I also plan
to write some elisp code that will enable emacs to work more with my system.


When I get better at programming I hope to create a package manager interface
for dnf, so I can control my package management via emacs :)
