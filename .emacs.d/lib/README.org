#+title: Zonaimacs Backend
I'm not any good at Lisp programming so I decided to make a Zonaimacs backend via Python.
I could have done this "backend" via Shell Scripting but I'm not any good at that either.
I also believe that having Python manage certain things would be better than a Shell Script.
Also I feel like I shouldn't have to note this, but please at least have Python3 installed before further usage...

* Usage
You should be able to execute the backend.py file and be able to use it like any other cli utilites.
As of now *backend.py* is only able to take in a single argument (I'm planning on adding more features...).


Example:
#+begin_src
  $ ./backend.py <OPTIONS> or python3 backend.py <OPTIONS>
  usage: backend.py [-h] {iZonaimacs,iGuix,iTPS,getEnv} ...

  Zonaimacs Python Backend;

  positional arguments:
    {iZonaimacs,iGuix,iTPS,getEnv}
      iZonaimacs          Installs Zonaimacs (ROOT)
      iGuix               Installs GNU Guix (ROOT)
      iTPS                Turns Current System into "ThePirateShip" (Arch, ROOT)
      getEnv              Prints Out User's Environment Variables

  options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit

* Extra
** Why Python?
Originally I was going to do Rust but then I thought about how Rust's abilities weren't needed,
Rust is a strongly compiled language so having this backend that I wanted to simply executed, Rust
wouldn't be needed.

** What can this backend do?
- The backend will be able to set up GNU Guix (Zonaimacs' package manager) & Zonaimacs.
- The backend will soon be able to handle setting up the entirety of my Arch Linux system (TPS) & custom "profiles" on a basic Arch installation.


- The backend is now able to detect and print out the entirety of the user's environment variables.
Hoping to add more shit to make this more of a backend and less of an installation script...
